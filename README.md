Eugene's Escape is a 3D platformer created using Unity and C#.

In Eugene's Escape, you will play as Eugene, a man taken away from his home and transformed into a dizzy robot. Eugene must make his way through several different obstacles, puzzles, and environments to finally return home. 

See the scripts I wrote [here.](https://github.com/ncullmann/Eugenes-Escape/tree/master/Assets/Scripts)
